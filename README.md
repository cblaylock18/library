# library

The Library App is a small application that allows users to manage a collection of books. Users can add new books to their library, view all books in a structured layout, remove books, and toggle the read status of each book. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Features
Add new books through a user-friendly form.
Display all books in the library.
Remove books from the library.
Toggle the read status of books.

Usage
Click the “NEW BOOK” button to open the form and enter the details of the new book. Once added, books will be displayed in a card format. Each book card includes options to remove the book or change its read status. The form submission is handled using JavaScript to update the library dynamically without refreshing the page.
